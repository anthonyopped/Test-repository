My name is Anthony Oppedisano and my program is Medical Genetics. My research project is with the Farrer lab looking at the genetics of Parkinson's Disease. In this course, I hope to gain the ability to utilize RStudio and statistial methodology to aid my research going further. 

This repository contains my work for STAT540, which is very cool and has awesome TAs! :bowtie:
